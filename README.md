# Core-Point

A Keras based Regressor Model to locate the Core Point in the fingerprint

It works by predicting the values of coordinates of the Core Point by taking the input image of the fingerprint and the mask of the core point as channels of input and outputs the value of x and y, the coordinates of the Core Point
